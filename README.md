# image_denoising
An application that takes a noisy image and predicts a cleaned (denoised) version, providing uncertainty estimates for each pixel.

- Image processing: scikit-image (for adding noise and basic image handling)
- Probabilistic modeling: Pyro (with PyTorch) or TensorFlow Probability
- Visualization: matplotlib (for comparing original, noisy, and denoised images with uncertainty maps)
